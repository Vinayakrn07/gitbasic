git push Command
The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. It transfers commits from your local repository to a remote repository, exporting commits to remote branches, which are configured using the git remote command.

Important Note: Pushing has the potential to overwrite changes. Always use caution when pushing, especially when there might be conflicting commits. Git prevents you from pushing changes that would result in a non-fast-forward merge by default.

Basic Usage
bash
Copy code
git push <remote> <branch>
Push the specified branch to the remote repository, along with all necessary commits and internal objects.
This creates a corresponding branch in the destination repository if it doesn't already exist.
Git prevents overwriting commits in case of a non-fast-forward merge.
Force Push
bash
Copy code
git push <remote> --force
This command forces a push, even if it results in a non-fast-forward merge.
Caution: Use the --force flag only if you are sure that overwriting changes is necessary and safe.
Push All Local Branches
bash
Copy code
git push <remote> --all
Pushes all your local branches to the specified remote repository.
Push Tags
bash
Copy code
git push <remote> --tags
Tags are not automatically pushed when pushing branches or using the --all option.
This command pushes all your local tags to the remote repository.
